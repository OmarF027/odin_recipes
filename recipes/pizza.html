    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough:Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water, gradually add the flour, then the salt and olive oil. Knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Let it rise: Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rise for at least 6-8 hours at room temperature (or 24 hours in the fridge for better fermentation).</li>
        <li>Shape the base: Roll out the dough on a floured surface until you get a thin round shape.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the base, drizzle with olive oil, and add a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Bake: Preheat the oven to the highest temperature (250째C / 480째F) and bake for about 7-10 minutes. If using a wood-fired oven, bake at 450째C (850째F) for about 90 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add mozzarella: Halfway through baking, add the mozzarella cut into pieces and continue baking until melted and slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven, add fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
